The folder 'Activation Product Effects' contains the counting data of CeBr3 crystals resulting from the continuous bombardment of 
a PMMA target with a carbon ion beam at 190.19 MeV/u for 15 minutes.

The folder "Counts" records CeBr3 crystal counting data for PMMA targets bombarded with carbon ion beams ranging 
from 160.86 MeV/u to 211.44 MeV/u.

The folder 'Energy_Sperstrum' contains spectral data for both on-beam and off-beam measurements 
acquired using the ORTEC-ASPEC-927 multi-channel analyzer.

The CeBr3 crystal and the integrated IC synchronously record data every 100us, and the acquisition system uploads data to the host computer every 10ms.
In the collected data, each line represents one uploaded data packet (204 data in total). Among them, the first 4 data are marker characters, 
5~104 are data recorded by the integrated IC, and 105~204 are data recorded by the CeBr3 crystal.


The folder 'Simulation_GATE' contains the Geant4/GATE program.
