BackGround.Spe: After a counting experiment, the background measurement of the treatment room is taken after a target has been removed.

BeamOn.Spe and BeamOn-2.Spe are two in-beam energy spectrum measurements. The CeBr3 detector was positioned 1.3m away from the beam line during the data acquisition.

BeamOff.Spe is the off-beam energy spectrum measurement data. The measurement was taken with the CeBr3 detector positioned 100 mm away from the beam line.
